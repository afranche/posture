# Posture

WIP Lightweight ASPM tool and vulnerability tracker

## Why ?

Posture was initially planned as a DefectDojo fork, a renowed ASPM tool
employed in DevSecOps teams. However, Posture was created on a fresh
base instead as DefectDojo bears a pretty heavy codebase as a result of
its many features. While Posture plans to support similar problems than
DefectDojo, their implementation will probably differ from how DefectDojo
handles them.

_What does it mean for you ?_ It means you can try both and get a feeling
at what suits your organization more! :heart_hands:
